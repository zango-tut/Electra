                <h1>Resistor</h1>
                <p>
                    A resistor is an electronic component that limits the flow of electric current in a circuit. It follows Ohm's Law, where the current is proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to resistance. Resistors come in different values and materials, helping protect components, control voltage, and adjust current. They can be fixed or variable, depending on the circuit's needs.

                <h1>Capacitors</h1>
                <p>
                    A capacitor is a passive electronic component that stores and releases electrical energy in the form of an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. When a voltage is applied across the plates, the capacitor stores charge, and when the voltage is removed or changes, it discharges the stored energy. Capacitors are commonly used in circuits to smooth out voltage fluctuations, filter signals, and store energy for short periods. They are measured in farads (F), with smaller values used in most electronics, such as microfarads (ÂµF) or picofarads (pF). Capacitors are crucial in applications like power supplies, signal processing, and timing circuits.

                <h1>AC and DC</h1>
                <p>AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current) are two types of electrical current that differ primarily in the direction of flow. AC alternates its direction periodically, with the voltage fluctuating between positive and negative in a sinusoidal wave pattern, making it ideal for long-distance power transmission and use in household appliances. On the other hand, DC flows in a single, constant direction, maintaining a steady voltage, and is typically used in devices like batteries, electronics, and solar panels. While AC is more efficient for transmitting power over large distances, DC is better suited for applications requiring a stable, constant current, such as in mobile devices and electric vehicles.</p>
